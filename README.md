# Google Gemini API with Python in Google Colab

## Overview
This repository provides a guide on how to use the Google Gemini API with Python in Google Colab. The Google Gemini API enables powerful AI capabilities such as text generation, natural language understanding, and more.

## Features
- Access Google Gemini API using Python
- Run seamlessly in Google Colab
- Perform AI-driven tasks such as text generation and analysis

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have:
- A Google account
- Access to Google Colab
- An API key for Google Gemini (obtainable from Google AI)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Open Google Colab.
2. Install required libraries (if necessary):
   ```python
   !pip install google-generativeai
   ```
3. Import necessary modules:
   ```python
   import google.generativeai as genai
   ```
4. Set up your API key:
   ```python
   genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
   ```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s a basic example to generate text using the Gemini API:

```python
import google.generativeai as genai

genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

response = genai.generate_text(prompt="Write a short poem about AI")
print(response.text)
```

## Running in Google Colab
1. Click on `Open in Colab` or upload the notebook to Google Colab.
2. Run the cells step by step.
3. Modify prompts and experiment with different AI tasks.
